## Overview

## Details

{{source_grounded_explanation}}

<!-- Only when this source explicitly conflicts with an existing claim; keep both, attributed, uncertainty stated. Silence is not a contradiction. -->
> [!warning] Contradiction
> {{claim_a_with_source}} / {{claim_b_with_source}}

<!-- Only for confidence: high or synthesis-heavy pages. -->
> [!note] Bias Check
> Counter-argument: {{counter_argument}}
> Data gap: {{data_gap}}

<!-- Only for layer: scale, and only when the paper develops or validates the scale (upstream Template_Scale Page). Then also add to the frontmatter, after layer: `measuredConstruct` (the construct as a quoted wikilink string) and `itemCount` (an integer); omit both otherwise. -->
> [!warning] 저작권 주의
> Do not reproduce the full item text of a commercially or restrictively licensed scale verbatim. Full items only for an openly licensed scale; otherwise an item summary plus the original source.

## Measured Construct

- Construct: [[{{measured_construct}}]] — {{operational_definition_author_definition_quoted_verbatim}}
- Distinction: {{how_it_differs_from_similar_constructs}}

## Development

- Original: {{developer_year}} — [[{{paper_hub_or_raw_source}}]]
- Revisions and short forms: {{version_history}}

## Items

- Item count: {{item_count}} / response format: {{response_format}} / subfactors: {{factor_structure}}
- Reverse items: {{reverse_items}} / deleted during development: {{deleted_items}}
- {{open_scale_item_list_or_summary_plus_source}}

## Psychometrics

Reliability and validity are sample-dependent: one row per study here, never in frontmatter.
