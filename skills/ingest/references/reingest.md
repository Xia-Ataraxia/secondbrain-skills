# Source update and reprocessing

Two different cases. Decide which one applies before writing anything, and say which in the report.

- **Source update:** the original itself changed — a new edition, a revised page, a newer repository commit. Proof is a comparison of newly obtained content against the existing Raw's `## Original Content`, not a date or a title.
- **Reprocessing:** the original is unchanged, but its existing Raw or the Wiki pages compiled from it need another pass — a better extraction of the same version, a missed concept, a Step 3 rule applied afresh.

## Identity

- Find the existing Raw by `source` first, then by any other source address or locator that note already records (an earlier URL, a DOI, a file or page locator). A title never proves sameness.
- Read the identity values as they are. Do not add, rename or migrate identity keys; migration runs only under the explicit authorization in [frontmatter](frontmatter.md).
- When two Raws match, or the match rests only on a weak locator, stop that item and report the candidates.

## Source update

1. Obtain the new version through the per-material reference and compare it with the existing Raw's `## Original Content`.
2. Ask the owner before writing: minor or major change. Without an answer, write nothing for this item.
3. Minor: keep the existing Raw byte-for-byte. Record the difference in the report; update Wiki pages only through Step 3.
4. Major: save a new Raw `YYYY-MM-DD-{title}-v2.md` (next free suffix) through Step 2 with the new verbatim content and `supersedes: "[[earlier raw]]"`. In the earlier Raw change only `superseded-by: "[[new raw]]"` and `date_modified`; its body, human notes and every other key stay. Both Raws stay.
5. Compile through Steps 3–4. Pages keep the earlier Raw in `source` and add the new one. A claim the new version changes follows Step 3: keep both, attributed, with `> [!warning] Contradiction` unless the correction is verified; a claim the new version drops is not thereby disproved.

## Reprocessing

1. Never rewrite an existing Raw body or its human notes. A better extraction of the same version becomes a new Raw through Step 2 whose `referenced` points at the earlier Raw, with the reason in `## Ingest Notes`; the earlier Raw stays.
2. Wiki updates use the existing Raw (or the new extraction) as the source and follow Step 3's clean-context writer and preservation review. Valid existing content stays; nothing is regenerated wholesale.
3. Changing only metadata of existing notes is not reprocessing; it needs explicit migration authorization.

## Batches

The owner names the batch: which items, in what scope. Each item is one run of the steps above. Run one representative item first and report it; the pilot does not authorize the rest of the batch.

A web-book item needs an owner-selected multi-page source with at least five chapters and two directly fetched chapter URLs; a commercial or offline book follows the file and page locator adaptation in [books](books.md).

## Record

- Every written item updates `index.md` and appends to `log.md` per Step 5, with `reingest` as the operation: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] reingest | {source title}`, naming update or reprocessing, the Raws written and the pages touched.
- `log.md` and the Raws' `supersedes` / `superseded-by` / `referenced` links are the record of what was reprocessed. A commit message or trailer is not evidence that an item was reprocessed; a normal ingest commit is not a reprocessing record.
- An interrupted batch is resumed from `log.md` and readback of the touched notes: finish or report each unfinished item. Never reset, check out or delete to clean up.
- No commit or push. A commit only when the owner separately asks, per [git provenance](git-provenance.md).
